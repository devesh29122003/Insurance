# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

An end-to-end data science project to analyze and predict healthcare costs using individual characteristic data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and predictive modeling on a medical insurance dataset. The goal is to understand how factors like age, BMI, and smoking status impact annual charges and to build a model that accurately estimates these costs.

## 📊 Dataset Features
The analysis uses a dataset of 1,338 records with the following attributes:
* **Age:** Primary beneficiary's age.
* **Sex:** Gender (female/male).
* **BMI:** Body Mass Index (weight relative to height).
* **Children:** Number of dependents covered.
* **Smoker:** Smoking status (yes/no).
* **Region:** Residential area in the US.
* **Charges:** Individual medical costs (Target Variable).

## ⚙️ Key Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Importing data with `pandas` and verifying there are no missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions and correlations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing categorical variables for machine learning models.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing regression analysis to estimate charges.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python** (Core language)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (Development environment)
