Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on a medical insurance dataset. The primary goal is to understand how different individual characteristics—such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region—impact annual medical insurance charges and to build a model that can accurately estimate these costs.

Dataset Features
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing 1,338 records with the following attributes:

Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.

Sex: Gender (female/male).

BMI: Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body weight relative to height.

Children: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance.

Smoker: Smoking status (yes/no).

Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).

Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (Target Variable).

Key Workflow
Data Loading & Cleaning: Importing the dataset using pandas and checking for missing values (none were found in this dataset).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summary of numerical features (mean, standard deviation, quartiles).

Visualizing distributions and correlations using seaborn and matplotlib.

Data Preprocessing: Preparing categorical variables for machine learning models.

Predictive Modeling: (Note: Based on your notebook, the initial analysis and data exploration are complete; you can add specific models like Linear Regression or Random Forest if you have implemented them further down).

Technologies Used
Python (Core programming language)

Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation and numerical analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (Interactive development environment)
